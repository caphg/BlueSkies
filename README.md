BlueSkies
=========

Here is some of my example code which is being used in BlueSkies Android app. This is not the complete code, but enough to show some development principles.
Of course, feel free to visit Google Play and download the app :)

App description goes as follows:
BlueSkies provides real time weather data from around the Globe. What makes a difference between this and other weather apps are the sources which are being used. BlueSkies uses wide range of data sources (listed below) which are aggregated together  to provide the most accurate forecast possible for a given location.

The Dark Sky Company, LLC is to be thanked for providing the API for weather conditions. This application    simply uses it to display data on your Android device. BlueSkies is developed independently and for free. The Dark Sky Company provides 1000 forecast views per user account daily for free, therefore everyone should register their own account. This is to be done during the first use of application.
For registration you need an e-mail address and the whole process is done within app in a minute.
In case the app doesn't automatically recognize API key from registration page it is due to JavaScript issues and you should copy and paste the key manually(Settings->Change API Key).
Terms of Service issued by The Dark Sky Company, LLC also apply to this application.


Some of the main features are:
-Hour-by-hour forecasts out to 48 hours
-Day-by-day forecasts out to 7 days
-"Time Machine" forecast - data for 60 years in the past to 10 years in the future - possible to enter in app
-Choose between Si or Imperial units
-GPS detection of current location and providing data for that location
-Entering location name and providing data for that location
-Automatic registration from within the app
